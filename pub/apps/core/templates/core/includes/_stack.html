        We believe entrepreneurs don't need to become software engineers to leverage the power of code. You need to learn just enough to be dangerousâ€”enough to validate ideas quickly, automate repetitive tasks, and speak the language when hiring developers.

        Our stack focuses on the easiest tools for non-coders to get started: Django for robust backends, HTMX for interactive frontends without complex JavaScript, Alpine.js for simple interactivity, and Tailwind CSS for beautiful designs. These tools work together seamlessly and let you build real applications without getting overwhelmed.

        Once you grasp the foundations with our stack, AI-assisted coding becomes incredibly powerful. You can prompt better, debug smarter, and extend simple solutions into sophisticated systems. AI tools become your coding partner, helping you polish and enhance what you've built.
